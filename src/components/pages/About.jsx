          <p>
            I'm a passionate B.Tech Data Science student from Suryoday College of Engineering, Nagpur, with a strong interest in technology, problem-solving, and creating meaningful digital experiences. I enjoy turning complex data and ideas into simple, smart, and user-friendly solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            My focus is on building projects that are not only functional but also clean, intuitive, and impactful. Along with data science, I explore web development and design to create solutions that are both technically strong and visually appealing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I constantly work on improving my skills through real-world projects, learning new tools, and experimenting with ideas. My goal is to grow as a data-driven problem solver and build innovative solutions that make a difference.
